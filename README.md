# PPLS
Please also install O2PLS (from selbouhaddani/O2PLS) and ggplot2 in order to make PPLS work.

require(devtools)
install_github("selbouhaddani/PPLS/Package/PPLS")
library(PPLS)

If this doesn't work, try downloading the tar or zip file and install from local disk.

For questions mail me or file an issue
